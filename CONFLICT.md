# Code of Conflict

When contributing to the Rouge programming language project, your code will be (hopefully carefully) reviewed, and critiqued when necessary. Changes may need to be made to improve the code you wish to contribute. This is done in the hope that most or all of the code that is contributed is the best it could possibly be.

This code review process should be performed in a generally respectful and polite manner. If that's not happening, please contact me so I can help resolve the sitution to the best of my (albeit limited) abilities.

In the words of Bill and Ted - "Be excellent to each other."
