## Part 1. The Language

This part describes the specifics of the language's syntax and grammar - how to write Rouge code.

[Overview](./1_language/0_overview.md)

## Part 2. The Compiler

This part describes how the compiler should generate bytecode based on the syntax defined in the previous part - how Rouge code is understood.

## Part 3. The Runtime

This part describes how the Rouge runtime environment (RTE, also virtual machine or VM) functions.

## Part 4. The Object File

This part describe the Rouge Object (.robj) file format, which is used to contain pre-compiled bytecode that can be immediately executed by the RTE.
