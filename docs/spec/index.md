# The Rouge Spec

The Rouge specification is split into multiple parts which cover different aspects of the language.

 - The first part covers the language's syntax.
 - The second part covers how the bytecode compiler should handle different bits of syntax.
 - The third part covers the instruction set for the runtime environment.
 - The fourth part covers the file format used to hold pre-compiled bytecode.
 - The fifth part covers how the runtime environment should behave.
 - The sixth part covers how the runtime environment should interact with native code.
