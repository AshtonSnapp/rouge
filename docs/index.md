# Rouge Documentation

Rouge (pronounced 'rooj', like the Louisiana state capital of Baton Rouge) is a statically-typed programming language designed for use in both general applications programming and in scripting. Essentially, it's meant to fit in the same niche as languages like Python, Ruby, and Lua, while having many of the features of Rust.

## The (not so formal) Specification

Since the language isn't really anywhere near complete yet, and things are always changing, the spec is going to act as a guide for how certain features of the language and runtime should be implemented. This is better than trying to write a user guide for a functionally non-existent language and having to change that documentation every time I decide to make a change to the language...
