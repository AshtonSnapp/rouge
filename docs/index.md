## The (not so formal) Specification

Since the language isn't really anywhere near complete yet, and things are always changing, the spec is going to act as a guide for how certain features of the language and runtime should be implemented. This is better than trying to write a user guide for a functionally non-existent language and having to change that documentation every time I decide to make a change to the language...
