# Introduction to Rouge

TBD

## Conventions

Some conventions will be used throughout this guide to the language.

Rouge code will be placed into code blocks that look like this:

```rouge
pub func main():
	# code goes here...
end
```

Sometimes you'll need to work in the terminal, or command-line. If you're on Linux or macOS, or using PowerShell on Windows, you'll want to pay attention to code blocks that look like this:

```
$ mkdir -p ~/projects/rouge
$ cd ~/projects/rouge
```

If you're using the regular Command Prompt on Windows, you'll want to pay attention to code blocks that look like this:

```
> mkdir "%USERPROFILE%\projects\rouge"
> cd /d "%USERPROFILE%\projects\rouge"
```

## Installation

TBD: Rouge really isn't mature yet...
